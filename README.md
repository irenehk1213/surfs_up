## Challenge: Further Analysis in Seasonal Data 
For an additional information--seasonal data--I've gathered data on the seasons June & December of Oahu and through the result of the data, which will help in determining whether the seasons could affect the surf and ice cream shop business. 

Below are statistics data summary of the temperature in June and December throughout the years.

Through the statistical summary of the temperature in summer (June) & winter (December), we could figure that the temperature would not affect the business of surf & ice cream shop since the range of fluctuation in temperature is not crucial. As you can see below statistical data about the month of June and December throughout the several years, we can discover that the mean (average) of temperature is 74 F and 71 F accordingly which is nearly the same. However, there will be definitely decreased number of customer in winter due to seasonal weather influence nevertheless; as you can see, the minimum temperature in summer in summer is 64F while winter recorded 56F which is relatively lower clearly while the maximum temperature in summer recorded 85F while it was 83F in winter. In fact, due to the geographic characteristic of Hawaii (relatively warm throughout the year), we can discover the mere difference in maximum temperature even between summer and winter by 85F and 83F accordingly. However, we can see thereâ€™s a temperature difference between day and night nearly 30F degree in winter, thus the fact  implies that there will be relatively fewer customer will visit and the business might be slower during winter. 

Through the statistics data, I can suggest the following two recommendations: 
1. Although we can read the overall brief tendency between the season based on the statistic data, it is hard to analyze or evaluate the business in depth since we got no figures in terms of sales and revenue. Therefore, I suggest to retrieve the sales history as well for further in depth advice for better profit. 
2. however, with the season data based on the temperature statistic summary, I can suggest him to sell items during winter season such as souvenirs or hot drinks or even other promotions and events to keep the number of customers during the winter as well. 

In conclusion, I could say that the data ensures that there will be fairly constant number of customers throughout the year to sustain the business in stable state.
